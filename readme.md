# Advent of Code

This contains my solution to the Advent of Code programming challenges. Each year is split into its own class library, containing a collection of `IChallenge` implementations representing the individual challenges for that year. The challenge input is read from `input.txt`, solved by the challenge implementation, and then output to the console.
